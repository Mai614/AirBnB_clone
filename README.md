## Description

The Airbnb Clone project involves building a command interpreter to manage various objects in the application. This is the initial step towards creating a full web application that emulates Airbnb's functionality. The project involves creating a parent class called `BaseModel` to handle initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances. Various classes representing different Airbnb objects (User, State, City, Place, etc.) will inherit from `BaseModel`.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows you to perform the following actions:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, Place)
- Retrieve objects from storage
- Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
- Update attributes of objects
- Delete objects

## Getting Started

To get started with the Airbnb Clone project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

To use the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Run the command interpreter by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   ./console.py
   ```bash
2. You will see a prompt indicating that the command interpreter is active.
3. Enter commands to perform actions on the objects. Use the help command to see a list of available commandes.

## Examples
Here are some examples of using the command interpreter:
- Creating a new User: 
```bash
(hbnb) create User
